# ScRNA-Seq
# Single cell transcriptome sequencing (single cell RNA sequencing,
single cell RNA-seq, or scRNA seq) scRNA-seq measures the RNA molecules within each cell of a given sample.
This information provides a snapshot of the transcriptome (the genes that were being transcribed) when the cells were harvested
# Why scRN-seq?
    It is used to determine transcriptional activity across thousands of cells to discover complex and rare cell populations and gain further insight
    into the dynamic nature of the transcriptome.
 # Analysis of scRNA-seq data using R:
 Seurat is an R package designed for QC, analysis, and exploration of single-cell RNA-seq data. Seurat aims to enable 
 users to identify and interpret sources of heterogeneity from single-cell transcriptomic measurements, and to integrate diverse types of single-cell data
